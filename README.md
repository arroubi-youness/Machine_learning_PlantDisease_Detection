    <h1>Machine Learning Plant Disease Detection ğŸŒ±ğŸŒ¿</h1>
    <p>This project leverages machine learning algorithms such as <strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong>, <strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</strong>, <strong>Decision Tree</strong>, <strong>Random Forest</strong>, and <strong>NaÃ¯ve Bayes</strong> to detect plant diseases.</p>
    <p>The model extracts important features from plant images using techniques like <strong><span style="color: #FF5733;">Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #FF5733;">wavelets</span></strong>.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #28a745;">A key finding of the project is that the SVM algorithm, when combined with color-based features, provides more accurate results for disease detection.</span></strong></p>
    <p>These features are then used to train and evaluate classifiers for precise disease identification. The goal is to provide early detection of plant diseases, enabling farmers to take preventive measures, improve crop yield, and enhance plant health management.ğŸŒ±ğŸŒ¿</p>
